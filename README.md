## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

### React components

These are responsible for building UI components and interactivities on the client. As they are just React components, you can probably extract and use them anywhere else (in React project, or Nextjs project ...).
It also follows design-guide carefully in order to create modern looking UI. By quickly modifying color primary / typography / spacing system in tailwind-themes.js you are good to go with your brand.
